# Active Context: Online Learning Trading System

## Current Focus
The current focus is on ensuring the project structure is properly organized and all necessary files are in place. Recent work has involved:

1. Restoring the `src` directory contents from the main branch to the ex-collect branch
2. Adding files that were unique to the ex-collect branch back to the main branch
3. Setting up the Memory Bank to maintain project context and documentation

## Recent Changes

### Repository Structure
- Restored `src` directory contents from main branch to ex-collect branch
- Added ex-collect branch-specific files to main branch, including:
  - `src/__init__.py` and other module `__init__.py` files
  - `src/strategy/notebooks/ModelTraining.ipynb`
  - `data/strategy/models/` directory with various model implementations
  - `data/strategy/logs/README.txt`

### Branch Management
- Identified differences between main and ex-collect branches
- Synchronized content between branches to ensure no information is lost
- Main branch now contains all files from both branches

## Current State
- The main branch is now the source of truth, containing all project files
- The ex-collect branch has the src directory contents restored but is missing some test files
- The project structure follows the modular architecture defined in the system patterns

## Active Decisions

### Branch Strategy
- Decision needed on whether to maintain multiple branches or consolidate to main
- If multiple branches are needed, clear purpose for each branch should be defined
- Consider implementing a more structured branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow)

### Testing Approach
- Tests directory exists in main branch but is incomplete in ex-collect branch
- Need to decide on testing strategy and ensure test coverage for all modules
- Consider implementing automated testing as part of the development workflow

### Documentation
- Memory Bank has been established to maintain project context
- Need to keep documentation updated as the project evolves
- Consider adding more detailed documentation for each module

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks
1. Review and update the test suite to ensure comprehensive coverage
2. Implement any missing functionality in the core modules
3. Ensure consistent code style and documentation across the project
4. Set up automated testing and continuous integration

### Medium-term Goals
1. Enhance the strategy module with additional machine learning models
2. Improve the evaluation framework for more comprehensive backtesting
3. Develop a more robust reporting system for strategy performance
4. Implement real-time monitoring for trading execution

### Long-term Vision
1. Create a web interface for visualization and control
2. Support for multiple asset classes and trading venues
3. Implement advanced machine learning techniques for strategy development
4. Develop a community of users and contributors

## Open Questions
1. How should we handle data storage for large historical datasets?
2. What is the optimal approach for real-time data processing?
3. How can we ensure the system is robust against market disruptions?
4. What metrics should be prioritized for strategy evaluation?
