# Project Brief: Online Learning Trading System

## Project Overview
The Online Learning Trading System is a comprehensive platform designed to implement and evaluate trading strategies using machine learning and technical analysis. The system collects market data, processes it, trains models, evaluates strategies, and executes trades in both simulated and real environments.

## Core Objectives
1. Develop a modular, extensible trading system architecture
2. Implement data collection and processing pipelines for market information
3. Create a framework for strategy development and evaluation
4. Build a trading execution system for both paper and real trading
5. Provide comprehensive reporting and monitoring capabilities

## Key Components
1. **Market Information**: Collection and processing of market data
2. **Strategy**: Development and training of trading strategies
3. **Evaluation**: Backtesting and real-time evaluation of strategies
4. **Trading**: Execution of trades based on strategy signals
5. **Report**: Generation of reports and alerts

## Technical Requirements
1. Python-based implementation
2. Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
3. Support for multiple data sources and trading venues
4. Comprehensive testing framework
5. Logging and monitoring capabilities

## Project Structure
The project follows a structured organization with separate modules for each key component:
- `src/`: Source code directory
  - `market_information/`: Market data collection and processing
  - `strategy/`: Strategy development and training
  - `evaluation/`: Backtesting and evaluation
  - `trading/`: Trade execution
  - `system/`: System-wide utilities and configuration
  - `report/`: Reporting and alerting
- `data/`: Data storage
- `docs/`: Documentation
- `tests/`: Test suite

## Current Status
The project structure has been established, and the basic implementation of each component has been completed. The system is currently being refined and extended with additional features and improvements.
